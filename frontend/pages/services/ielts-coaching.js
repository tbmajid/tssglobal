        The International English Language Testing System (IELTS) is a test that
        assesses your ability to communicate in English. It is the most widely
        accepted and accredited English proficiency exam in the world, with more
        than 10,000 educational institutions, professional alliances,
        immigration authorities, and employers all using it. The British Council
        and the IDP education system coordinate the exam, which measures the
        applicant’s accuracy in four separate modules of English language,
        including Listening, Reading, Writing, and Speaking, from all over the
        world. This exam is for people who want to immigrate or study in
        English-speaking countries.
      </Box>
      <Box sx={{ typography: "h6", p: 2, margin: 2 }}>
        Over 3 million people from over 150 countries take the IELTS exam each
        year to apply for higher education, professional registration, and
        permanent residency.
      </Box>
      <Box sx={{ typography: "h6", p: 2, margin: 2 }}>
        The IELTS test is classified into two categories: academic and general.
        Applicants should begin their IELTS journey by deciding on which form of
        IELTS to take.

        <Box sx={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Academic Test: </Box>This test is for
        students interested in studying abroad in an English speaking country
        such as UK, USA, Canada and Australia.
      </Box>
      <Box sx={{ typography: "h6", p: 2, margin: 2 }}>
        People who intend to migrate or seeking jobs or work abroad take the
        General Test.

        The way these two versions of the test are graded is the most
        significant difference between them. True, IELTS Listening, Speaking,
        and Writing are scored similarly on the two exams, but IELTS Reading,
        which accounts for a full quarter of your total score, is measured
        differently on IELTS academic versus IELTS general.
