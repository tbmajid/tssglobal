          <Box sx={{ typography: "h6", p: 2, margin: 2 }}>
            We offer an Airport Pick-Up Service from London Heathrow Airport to
            various parts of the city. Please give two hours between the arrival
            of your flight and the departure of transport (private car or mini
            bus) to allow for immigration and luggage selection. To ensure a
            spot, let us know at least one weeks prior to the pick-up date. We
            suggest that you inform us as soon as your travel arrangements have
            been confirmed.

            We hope that a representative from TSS Global will be able to meet
            you in ‘Arrivals,’ but this is contingent on how many other people
            book the airport pick-up service. As a result, a few days prior to
            the pick-up date, we will send you an email with specific
            instructions on where to meet us at the airport. We’ll also give you
            a phone number to call on the day of pick-up.

            your room. If you are staying in self arranged private accommodation
            – depending on who else books the airport pick-up service, we may be
            able to take you to your private accommodation. Alternatively we
            will help to book a taxi/minicab/Uber. The cost of the
            transportation will vary depending on where you will be staying.

            International students can encounter difficulties when renting
            privately, especially when attempting to arrange housing from
            outside the country.
          </Box>{" "}
          <Box sx={{ typography: "h6", p: 2, margin: 2 }}>
            It can be difficult to organise in the first year of study due to a
            lack of knowledge of a country’s legal framework for renting and not
            being present to view properties. It’s also crucial to be aware of
            rental scams targeting foreign students. We will help you find a
            suitable property by suggesting letting agents or tenants, as well
            as any legal issues that might arise, such as verifying your
            identity.

          <Box sx={{ typography: "h6", p: 2, margin: 2 }}>
            Before you sign a rental agreement, you can discuss with us to make
            sure the letting agency or landlord is reputable and that the
            property you are renting is in a good student neighbourhood. Since
            students often live in the same parts of a town or city, this is
            typically easy to find out.

            Your National Insurance number (NINo) is a unique personal
            identification number used to track your National Insurance
            payments. You are not required to have a NINo before beginning work,
            but you must obtain one once hired.

            By calling 0800 141 2075, you can apply for a NINo. You will receive
            a letter requesting that you attend an appointment. If this occurs,
            the letter will specify which documents you must carry to the
            appointment. You’ll normally need to bring your passport, pay slips,
            or a letter from your university confirming your right to work in
            the UK. Your appointment will be held at a Jobcentre Plus near you.

            We offer the support our students need to secure part-time jobs. We
            understand that students often need or want additional income, and
            we want to assist you in finding jobs that are appropriate for you.
            Students may find a variety of jobs in London, ranging from stacking
            shelves at supermarkets to internships. There are part-time jobs for
            students, as well as holiday jobs and positions where you can work
            only a few hours per week, and these jobs can help you build your CV
            while still providing some extra cash to help you fund your college
            life in the city. We work closely with a number of leading UK
            recruiters to help our students to secure part time jobs while they

            If you are taking a course at degree level, you should be aware that
            your visa allows you to work a maximum of 20 hours per week during
            the academic year. If you are studying at below degree level (for
            example, a foundation programme), you should be limited to working a
            maximum of 10 hours per week during the academic year. However, you
            are permitted to work full time during university vacation period
            with some exceptions (e.g. PhD or research degree).

            If any of the following phrases appear on your visa, “No work” or
            “Work prohibited”; you are not permitted to work. If your visa
            allows you to work in the UK, you must not work more than the
            permitted number of hours a week, as this is a violation of your
            immigration conditions and a criminal offence. If you have doubts
            about your right to work in the UK, the permitted hours, or if visa
            says something unusual or something that you don’t understand,
            contact your TSS Consultant to discuss. Before you start working in
            the UK, double-check your permission to work and the hours you’re
            allowed to work. If you or your employer inadvertently violate the
            working conditions of your visa, you and your employer could face
            hefty fines and legal action.
